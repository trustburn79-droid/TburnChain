You are a senior blockchain infrastructure auditor. Perform a comprehensive production-readiness audit for the TBURN Mainnet before Genesis Pool activation.

Execute the following enterprise-grade checklist systematically:

## 1. GENESIS BLOCK & INITIAL STATE VERIFICATION
- Verify genesis.json configuration integrity (chain ID, initial validators, token allocations)
- Validate genesis block hash consistency
- Confirm initial token supply matches tokenomics specification (total supply, distribution ratios)
- Check pre-allocated addresses for foundation, ecosystem, staking rewards pools

## 2. CONSENSUS MECHANISM VALIDATION
- Test Triple-Band AI Orchestration consensus activation
- Verify validator registration and selection algorithms
- Simulate block production cycle under normal conditions
- Test consensus finality guarantees and confirmation times
- Validate slashing conditions and penalty mechanisms

## 3. NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE
- Test all RPC endpoints (HTTP, WebSocket) for stability
- Verify P2P node discovery and peer connections
- Check network partition tolerance and recovery
- Validate NAT traversal and firewall compatibility
- Test maximum concurrent connection handling

## 4. CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY
- Verify quantum-resistant cryptography implementation
- Test digital signature verification (transaction signing, block signing)
- Validate key derivation functions and wallet generation
- Check merkle tree construction and proof verification
- Audit randomness sources for validator selection

## 5. TRANSACTION PROCESSING
- Test transaction lifecycle (creation → propagation → inclusion → finality)
- Verify gas fee calculation and dynamic fee adjustment
- Test transaction throughput under load (target: 200,000+ TPS)
- Validate nonce management and replay protection
- Check transaction receipt generation and event logging

## 6. SMART CONTRACT RUNTIME
- Test VM execution environment stability
- Verify contract deployment and state persistence
- Test cross-contract calls and delegate calls
- Validate gas metering accuracy
- Check contract upgrade mechanisms if implemented

## 7. STAKING & VALIDATOR OPERATIONS
- Test stake delegation and undelegation flows
- Verify reward distribution calculations
- Test validator join/exit procedures
- Validate voting power calculations
- Check epoch transitions and reward cycles

## 8. TOKENOMICS IMPLEMENTATION
- Verify burn mechanism triggers and execution
- Test deflationary model calculations (20-year projection alignment)
- Validate yield pool distribution logic
- Check inflation/deflation rate adjustments
- Test token transfer restrictions if any

## 9. API & EXTERNAL INTERFACES
- Test JSON-RPC API compliance (eth_* compatible methods)
- Verify WebSocket subscription events
- Test API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Validate API authentication if required
- Check API response consistency and error handling

## 10. MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY
- Verify logging infrastructure (structured logs, log levels)
- Test metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana compatible)
- Check alerting thresholds for critical events
- Validate health check endpoints
- Test dashboard data accuracy

## 11. DISASTER RECOVERY & PERSISTENCE
- Test database backup and restoration procedures
- Verify state snapshot creation and loading
- Test node recovery from crash scenarios
- Validate chain data integrity after restart
- Check rollback procedures for emergency situations

## 12. SECURITY HARDENING
- Audit environment variable handling (no exposed secrets)
- Test input validation on all endpoints
- Check for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Validate access control mechanisms
- Test rate limiting effectiveness

## 13. PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS
- Run sustained load test (minimum 1 hour at target TPS)
- Measure block production latency
- Test memory consumption under load
- Check CPU utilization patterns
- Validate storage growth projections

## 14. DOCUMENTATION & OPERATIONAL READINESS
- Verify runbook completeness for common operations
- Check incident response procedures
- Validate deployment scripts and automation
- Test upgrade/migration procedures
- Confirm monitoring dashboard accessibility

For each category:
1. Execute relevant test scenarios
2. Report PASS/FAIL/WARNING status
3. Document any issues found with severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. Provide specific remediation steps for failures
5. Estimate effort required to fix issues

Output a final Production Readiness Score (0-100%) and GO/NO-GO recommendation for Genesis Pool activation.

If any CRITICAL issues are found, immediately flag them and halt further testing until resolved.
